Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Guru and I'm currently Lead Data Scientist in the Artificial Intelligence team at Aviva UK.

* My current interests include Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and more broadly using ML/AI to solve business problems. 

* I mostly use Python, bash, R, SQL and a lot of this is on the cloud (mostly AWS currently; but am familiar with GCP and Azure as well).

In a previous life, I worked in Bioinformatics R&D - you can check out my previous work on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=oG6yQ7IAAAAJ&hl=en).

You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gururadhakrishnan/).
