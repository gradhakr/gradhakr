Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Guru and I'm currently Lead Data Scientist in the Artificial Intelligence team at Aviva UK.

My current interests include using Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and more broadly ML/AI to solve business problems. I mostly use Python, bash, R, SQL for my work and a lot of this is on the cloud (mostly AWS currently; but am familiar with GCP and Azure as well).

In a previous life, I used to work in Bioinformatics R&D - you can check out my previous work [here](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=oG6yQ7IAAAAJ&hl=en)
